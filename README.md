This Terraform code is used to set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment on AWS with specific networking, security, and instance configurations. Hereâ€™s a summary of its components:

1. **VPC and Networking Setup**:
   - **VPC**: Creates a VPC with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16` and enables DNS hostnames.
   - **Subnet**: Defines a public subnet with CIDR `10.0.1.0/24` within the created VPC.
   - **Internet Gateway**: Attaches an internet gateway to allow internet access for the resources within the VPC.
   - **Route Table and Association**: Sets up a route table with a default route to the internet gateway and associates it with the public subnet.

2. **Security Groups**:
   - **Security Group `sg_target`**: Allows all outbound traffic (egress) and specific outbound traffic on TCP ports 443 and 444.
   - **Security Group `sg_target_02`**: Similar to `sg_target` with egress rules for all traffic and ports 443 and 444.
   - **Security Group Rule**: Adds an ingress rule to allow all inbound traffic between `sg_target` and `sg_target_02`.

3. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - **IAM Roles**: 
     - Retrieves an IAM role named "S3-XDR" and creates an IAM instance profile.
     - Creates an IAM role and policy for CloudWatch logging with permissions to manage log groups, streams, and events.
   - **Instance Profiles**: Adds profiles for both "S3-XDR" and "CloudWatchAgentRole" to assign IAM roles to instances.

4. **EC2 Instance**:
   - **AMI Selection**: Retrieves the latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI for the EC2 instance.
   - **Instance Configuration**: Creates an EC2 instance of type `t2.micro` with the IAM roles for S3 and CloudWatch specified. 

This code establishes a basic network structure with security rules, IAM configurations, and an EC2 instance in a secure, internet-accessible VPC environment.
